            <h2 id="new">What to know about  Pregnancy?</h2>
            <p id="nee">Pregnancy is a crucial period in a woman's life where she carries a developing fetus in her uterus. It is a complex biological process that involves various 
                changes in the woman's body to support the growth and development of the fetus. Here are some important things to know about pregnancy:
            </p><br>
            <p id="nee">Conception: Pregnancy occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg, usually during sexual intercourse. It is important to note that a woman is most 
                fertile around the time of ovulation, which typically occurs around 14 days after the start of her menstrual cycle.
            </p>    <br>           
            <p id="nee">Trimesters: Pregnancy is typically divided into three trimesters, each lasting about three months. During each trimester, the fetus undergoes significant 
                growth and development, and the woman experiences various physical and emotional changes.
            </p> <br>
            <p id="nee">Prenatal care: Prenatal care is important for ensuring a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby. It involves regular check-ups with a healthcare provider, 
                who will monitor the woman's health and the growth and development of the fetus. Prenatal care also includes various tests and screenings to detect any potential 
                complications.
            </p> <br>
            <p id="nee">Nutrition: Proper nutrition is essential for a healthy pregnancy. It is recommended that pregnant women consume a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, 
                vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Women may also need to take certain supplements, such as folic acid and iron, to support the developing fetus.
            </p> <br> 
            <p id="nee">Physical activity: Regular physical activity is important during pregnancy for maintaining a healthy weight, reducing the risk of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, 
                and promoting overall health and well-being. However, pregnant women should consult with their healthcare provider before starting or continuing any exercise program.
            </p> <br> 
            <p id="nee">Common symptoms: Pregnancy can cause various physical and emotional symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, fatigue, mood swings, and back pain. While these symptoms are 
                usually normal, pregnant women should consult with their healthcare provider if they are severe or persistent.
            </p> <br> 
            <p id="nee">Labor and delivery: Labor and delivery is the process of giving birth to a baby. It typically involves three stages: the onset of labor, the delivery of the baby, 
                and the delivery of the placenta. Women may choose to give birth in a hospital, birthing center, or at home, depending on their preferences and medical needs.
            </p> <br>
               <p id="nee"> Overall, pregnancy is a complex and transformative experience that requires careful attention to health and well-being for both the woman and the developing fetus.
